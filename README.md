This repository contains code, data, and interactive notebooks for an introductory workshop on Machine Learning (ML). The materials are designed for hands-on learning and cover essential ML concepts using real-world datasets.

## Contents

- `koh-et-al.ipynb` — Notebook for clustering and exploratory data analysis using the Koh et al. dataset.
- `guerrero-et-al.ipynb` — Notebook for regression and classification using the Guerrero et al. dataset.
- `data/` — Folder containing Excel data files and related PDFs for both studies.

## Workshop Topics

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- K-Means clustering and cluster interpretation
- Regression and classification with decision trees
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn

## Data Sources

- **Koh et al. (2024)**: Data on coaching and behavioral clusters
- **Guerrero et al.**: Data on health, activity, and quality of life
