For the clustering:

- The paper (to give you an idea of what are we speaking about)
- the data

For rule mining:
- the data (we can predict the columns AK-AQ - quality of life etc… based on the screen usage of digital and non digital media use - in the first columns)
- an example of paper

Or can be something on injury prevention in sport - see the slide attached

Of course you can find other data - anything related to kids/education would be awesome… but not compulsory.
