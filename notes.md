# Additional Info
Maybe a short presentation on:
•⁠  ⁠the principles of clustering (versus anova)
•⁠  ⁠⁠HCA and k-means principles, pros and cons
•⁠  ⁠⁠examples of application (and maybe they can run it on colab)
•⁠  ⁠⁠then principles of rule mining (maybe a simple random forest)
•⁠  ⁠⁠examples with the data (and maybe they can try it on colab)

I have some data, on teacher’s behavior (with which we can do clustering to profile the teaching styles), and other data on student’s physocal activity level, screen time, and sleep where we can do dome rule mining

# Email from Prof
For the clustering:

- The paper (to give you an idea of what are we speaking about)
- the data

For rule mining:
- the data (we can predict the columns AK-AQ - quality of life etc… based on the screen usage of digital and non digital media use - in the first columns)
- an example of paper

Or can be something on injury prevention in sport - see the slide attached

Of course you can find other data - anything related to kids/education would be awesome… but not compulsory.
